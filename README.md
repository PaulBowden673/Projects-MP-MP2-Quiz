**I built this website to give users a fun and enjoyable game to play. I based the game on Health & Safety questions so it can also be used for training**
## UX ##
**The purpose of this project is to create am interactive frontend website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In order to do this I have built a Health & Safety Quiz game, where the users have to answer 20 questions about general Workplace Health & Safety**






**I incorporated the following things in order for the target audience to have a great experience when visiting my website,**

- A Home page with buttons to start the game and also view the game rules.
- A rules section so users can learn how to play the game.
- A highscores section so users can keep track of thier scores and complete against other users for the highest score.
- A Contact form so users can contact me with feedback via EmailJS.
